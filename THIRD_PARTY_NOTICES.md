# Third-party source and license boundaries

Our original contributions are licensed under [Apache-2.0](LICENSE.txt).
This does not replace the licenses or permissions of upstream components.
Model weight licenses and access restrictions are independent of our code.

DiT model files retain Meta's copyright notices. The diffusion implementation
also attributes its OpenAI diffusion sources in the file headers. Modified
hybrid script headers identify the referenced policies and integrations.

## SeaCache release boundary

The referenced SeaCache source does not provide a visible license or notice
granting redistribution permission. Its source links are attribution, not a
license grant. The SeaCache-derived files must not be represented as covered
by our Apache-2.0 license. Obtain permission from the upstream authors or
otherwise establish applicable redistribution rights before a release that
includes these adaptations. This repository does not record such permission.
